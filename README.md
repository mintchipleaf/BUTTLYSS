## Configuration
BUTTLYSS can be configured by modifying the local config file (found at **ATLYSS/ATLYSS_DATA/buttlyssSettings.json**) to change the speed and duration of various vibration parameters.\
Its behaviour can also be modified live through various chat console commands.\
To restore BUTTLYSS to default settings, delete the local config file and either run the game again or use the `reload` command.
